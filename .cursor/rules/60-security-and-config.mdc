title: Security & Configuration
description: Always attach lightweight guardrails to avoid leaking secrets and committing keys.
attachments:
  mode: always
paths:
  include:
    - "**/*"
guidance:
  - Never hardcode API keys or tokens. Use env files and .gitignore them.
  - Do not log full requests/responses with secrets; redact before logging.
  - Keep Mapbox token in env; do not commit .env.
  - Avoid introducing analytics/telemetry for MVP unless explicitly requested.
notes:
  - If adding a backend, prefer local-only by default for development.
