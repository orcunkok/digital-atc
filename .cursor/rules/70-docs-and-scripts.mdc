title: Docs & Scripts
description: Auto-attach when editing README, docs, and small utilities. Keep examples minimal and accurate.
attachments:
  mode: auto
paths:
  include:
    - "README.md"
    - "docs/**"
    - "prompts/**"
guidance:
  - Ensure examples match current schemas and prompt files.
  - Shell examples must be copy-pasteable with ```bash fences and no leading "$ ".
  - Keep instructions under 80 characters per line where reasonable.
notes:
  - Update docs/REFERENCES.md links if schemas or prompts change materially.
