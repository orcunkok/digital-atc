attachments:
  mode: always
paths:
  include:
    - "prompts/**"
    - "lexicon/**"
    - "schemas/**"
guidance:
  - Callsign: letters -> ICAO/NATO (e.g., N123AB -> November … Alfa Bravo).
  - Digits -> FAA/ICAO words: 0 Zero, 1 Wun, 2 Too, 3 Tree, 4 Fower, 5 Fife, 6 Six, 7 Seven, 8 Eight, 9 Niner.
  - Altitudes in words (no bare digits in readback): e.g., 1500 -> “one thousand five hundred”.
  - Keep readbacks concise, include callsign, mirror key elements only.
notes:
  - Use lexicon/phonetics.json and lexicon/altitude_words.md for validation helpers.
