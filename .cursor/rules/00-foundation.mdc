guidance:
  - Use Vite + Vue with JavaScript (no TypeScript). Raw CSS only.
  - Use Mapbox GL JS for map layers. No other map libs.
  - Keep code formatted with Prettier (80 char print width).
  - Do not introduce state managers or CSS frameworks.
  - Respect repo schemas for agent IO:
    - Input: schemas/request.schema.json
    - Output: schemas/response.schema.json
  - Read/write distances as NM, speed kt, altitude ft, VS fpm, heading deg.
  - Do not change schemas without updating examples and validators.
  - Do not hardcode API keys; read from environment.
notes:
  - Prefer simple, explicit functions. Minimize abstractions for MVP speed.
  - Keep diffs small and files cohesive. Avoid creating new directories unless necessary.
