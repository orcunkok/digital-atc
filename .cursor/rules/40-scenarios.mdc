title: Scenarios & Events
description: Auto-attach for scenario JSONs and event timeline code. Keep scenario format stable and deterministic.
attachments:
  mode: auto
paths:
  include:
    - "scenarios/**"
guidance:
  - Scenario JSON fields: id, title, callsign, startState, events[].
  - Event types: ATC, ADD_TFR, ADD_TRAFFIC, INCIDENT (minimal set).
  - Keep coordinates (lon, lat) consistent; polygons closed; alt bands defined.
  - Do not bake provider secrets or internal URLs into scenarios.
  - Keep times (t) in seconds; avoid real-time coupling in JSON.
notes:
  - Provide small example generators if needed, but do not add runtime deps.
